# The root category uses the appender called A1. Since no priority is
# specified, the root category assumes the default priority for root
# which is DEBUG in log4j. The root category is the only category that
# has a default priority. All other categories need not be assigned a
# priority in which case they inherit their priority from the
# hierarchy.
